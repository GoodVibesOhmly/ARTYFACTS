## Asset Backed ERC721

Inspired by [Dan Matuszewski's tweet](https://twitter.com/cmsholdings/status/1422693860036206592) asking the tough question, what really is an NFT floor?

This extension of the ERC721 standard requires NFTs to be backed by ERC20 assets at mint. The NFT can be burned at any time in order to recover the backing asset. This gives NFTs a "true floor".  

A NFT ERC721 Staking smart contract that will issue reward tokens to all NFT holders. The files on the repo attached are used to:
